Project Inspiration

Ridesharing is a multi billion dollar industry has revolutionized the entire carpooling and taxi service experience.
Provides a comfortable and safe mode of transport where riders can choose from a wide variety of vehicles based on their preference and requirements.
Provides service in less populated or poorer areas that are not regularly served byÂ taxicabs and charging lower rates than taxicabs.

Data Source

We came up with an idea of plotting rideshare data for the City of Austin, TX; we found a data set which we think provides great 
information that can be somehow easily analyzed and plotted with either leaflet, Java and/or D3 among other coding methods.

Note:  In this team project, we completed two other visualizations using D3/js where a different data set was used due to that we experienced a great challenge when attempting to plot with D3/js the initial data set (rideshare) that we had in mind.
